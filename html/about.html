        <p class="md:max-w-[40vw]">We train athletes - professional, collegiate, youth, and anybody that wants to train like an athlete. When we speak of training we are talking about speed, strength, power, and sports therapy.</p>
        <p class="md:max-w-[40vw]">Our business is aimed at a health conscience adult who wants to move beyond the usual local gym.</p>
        <p class="md:max-w-[40vw]">ML Strength are Australia's newest brand in health and fitness, with gyms opening throughout the Brisbane metropolitan area. ML Strength believes fitness comes first and keeping fit and improving your health is not just a fad - it's a way of life. Whether your goal is weight loss, body building, nutrition or diet improvements, having more energy, or just looking and feeling better - we're here for you! </p>

        <p class="md:max-w-[40vw]">
          ML Strength can offer cutting edge exercise options, including group fitness classes and one-on-one personal training sessions for weight loss, circuit training, boxing and karate. Our trainers are all Les Mills accredited instructors and are second to none - all have Bachelor Degrees in Human Movements. 
        </p>
        <p class="md:max-w-[40vw]">
          We are a family operated business that has little to do with the rest of the fitness industry. Our gym world does not include the annoying telemarketers or membership consultants. Our gyms speak for themselves, our members do our marketing. We believe that word of mouth has way more credibility than something that a marketing machine dreams up.
